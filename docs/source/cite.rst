Although there's also a concept DOI pointing to the latest version, using the DOI associated with each release is recommended.

To find out which version of the package you're using, simply run:

.. role:: python(code)
   :language: python

.. code-block:: python

   import gaiaxpy
   print(gaiaxpy.__version__)

A paper is in preparation and details will be added here as soon as possible.
